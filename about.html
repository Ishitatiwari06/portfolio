        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Hello, I am Ishita Tiwari</h4>
        <p>
        A technology enthusiast with a strong curiosity for learning and exploring different
        domains within the tech industry. I enjoy understanding how technology works and applying
        my knowledge to build practical and meaningful solutions. I believe continuous learning and
        hands-on experience are key to growing as a professional in the ever-evolving tech world.
        </p>

        <p>
        My interests span across data science, web development, and software fundamentals. I have
        experience working with tools such as Python, SQL, and Excel for data analysis, and I enjoy
        extracting insights from data to support better decision-making. Alongside this, I also like
        creating clean and structured web interfaces using HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am familiar with using Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development,
        and I enjoy working in team-based environments where ideas and knowledge are shared.
        Through projects and continuous practice, I aim to strengthen my technical skills, improve my
        problem-solving abilities, and adapt to new technologies with confidence.
        </p>
